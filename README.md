# Emotion Recognition
Emotion recognition with the help of Convolutional Neural Networks. Coded in Python environment on Keras+Tensorflow.
1. Run load_data.py to pickle the dataset.
2. Run model.py to save the model.
3. Run emotion.py to train the model.

## Future Work
1. Improve the code.
2. Add Face recognition with the help of OpenCV.
